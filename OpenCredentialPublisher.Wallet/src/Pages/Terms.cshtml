    YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE
</p>
<p>
    IMS does not claim ownership of Content you submit or that you make
    available for inclusion on the Service. However, with respect to Content you
    submit or make available for inclusion on publicly accessible areas of the
    Service, you grant to IMS and all users of the Service a worldwide,
    royalty-free and non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable and fully
    sublicensable license to use, distribute, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish,
    translate, publicly perform and publicly display such Content (in whole or
    in part) and to incorporate such Content into other works in any format or
    medium now known or later developed.
</p>
<p>
    Additionally, with respect to Content you submit or make available for
    inclusion on publicly accessible areas of the Services, you represent and
    warrant that: (a) you have the right to grant such license and make such
    Content available to IMS and its licensees, including users of the Service;
    (b) none of the Content you provide contains any data or information that is
    confidential, non-public, owned by or otherwise proprietary to a third
    party, not in the public domain or otherwise restricted or protected from
    use by any individual, entity or other party for any use by a third party;
    and(c) neither the delivery to nor use by IMS or its licensees, including
    users of the Service, of such content shall violate or infringe the rights

</p>
<p>
    You understand that all information, data, text, software, music, sound,
    photographs, graphics, video, messages, tags, or other materials
    ("Content"), whether publicly posted or privately transmitted, are the sole

    via the Service.
</p>
<p>
    You acknowledge, consent and agree that IMS may access, preserve and

    parties; (d) respond to your requests for customer service; or (e) protect

    networks, and (b) changes to conform and adapt to technical requirements of
    connecting networks or devices.
</p>
<p>
    The Service may provide, or third parties may provide, links to other web
    sites or resources. Because IMS has no control over such sites and
    resources, you acknowledge and agree that IMS is not responsible for the
    availability of such external sites or resources, and does not endorse and
    is not responsible or liable for any content, advertising, products or other
    materials on or available from such sites or resources. You further
    acknowledge and agree that IMS shall not be responsible or liable, directly
    or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or
    in connection with use of or reliance on any such Content, goods or services
    available on or through any such site or resource.
</p>
<p>
    You acknowledge that IMS may establish general practices and limits
    concerning use of the Service, including without limitation the maximum
    number of days that Content will be retained by the Service, the maximum
    size of any or all Content files, the maximum disk space that will be
    allotted on IMS's servers on your behalf, and the maximum number of times
    (and the maximum duration for which) you may access the Service in a given
    period of time, and/or any other condition of the Service. You agree that
    IMS has no responsibility or liability for the deletion or failure to store
    any Content, messages and other communications or other materials or Content
    maintained or transmitted by the Service.

<p>
    GENERAL
</p>
<p>
    These Terms constitutes the entire agreement between you and IMS concerning
    your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and
    IMS with respect to the Service. You also may be subject to additional terms
    and conditions that may apply when you use or purchase certain other IMS
    services or 1EdTech Software, affiliate services, third-party content or
    third-party software. The Terms and the relationship between you and IMS
    shall be governed by the laws of the State of Massachusetts without regard
    to its conflict of law provisions. You and IMS agree to submit to the
    personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the city of
    Boston, Massachusetts. The failure of IMS to exercise or enforce any right
    or provision of the Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or
    provision. If any provision of the Terms is found by a court of competent
    jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court
    should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in
    the provision, and the other provisions of the Terms remain in full force
    and effect. The section titles in the Terms are for convenience only and
    have no legal or contractual effect.
</p>
<p>
    AMENDMENTS
</p>
<p>
    These Terms are subject to occasional revision, and if we make any
    substantial changes, we may notify you by sending you an e-mail to the last
    e-mail address you provided to us (if any) and/or by prominently posting
    notice of the changes on our site. Any changes to these Terms will be
    effective no later than thirty (30) calendar days following our posting of
    notice of the changes on our Site. Continued use of our Service following
    notice of such changes shall indicate your acknowledgement of such changes
    and agreement to be bound by the terms and conditions of such changes.
</p>
<p>

    suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or
    incomplete, IMS has the right to suspend or terminate your account, prevent
    your access to any or all portion of the Services and or Content (or other

</p>
<p>
    OFFERINGS AND FEES
</p>
<p>
    The Service may be available to you with or without charge. Access to
    certain features, functions, and/or full or partial portions of the Service
    may require payment. You may also be provided "trial", "demo", "beta" or
    other limited-functionality or limited-access versions of the Service and/or
    its parts with or without charge. In addition to any fees required to access
    certain features, capabilities, functions or services offered through or by
    the Service ("Charged Offerings"), you are responsible for paying all
    applicable taxes (including, but not limited to those we are not required to
    collect) and for all third party hardware, software, service and/or other
    costs you may incur in order to access the Service and your account. Neither
    these Terms nor your account entitle you to any subsequent releases of the
    Services, nor to any for-pay features, products, capabilities, features,
    upgrades or services offered, distributed or made available through the
    Service without paying applicable charges or except as otherwise expressly
    and explicitly provided by IMS. All or some of the Service may need to be

    and, where applicable, you must download and install any necessary software
    on each machine on which you wish to use and access the Service.
</p>
<p>
    Converting an account and/or specific Service version or offering, including
    but not limited to trial or limited functionality rights offerings, to an
    enhanced account and/or fee-based version of the Service or other paid
    account, version or other Charged Offering may result in the loss of access
    to the information or other data associated with your use of the free or
    non-paid version of the Service.
</p>
<p>
    You may terminate your account at any time. You will not receive full or
    partial refunds for subscription periods that you have purchased.
    Terminating a subscription for one Charged Offering does not necessarily
    terminate right(s) you may have for another Charged Offering, other portions
    of the Service, software or other offerings from IMS.
</p>
